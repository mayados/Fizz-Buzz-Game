# FizzBuzz Game in C#

It's an exercice made during my training. The user enter a number wich is the number of times the for loop is going to repeat itself. During the loop, if the rest of the division between the number and 3 and 5 is 0, then we display "FizzBuzz". If the rest is 0 between the number and 3 we display "Fizz", and between the number and 5 "Buzz". If it's none of the previous responses, we just display the number.
